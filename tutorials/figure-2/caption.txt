FIG. 1. (color online). (a) Two-dimensional search for optimal community numb ers in a synthetic network. The red crosses indicate where the graph partitions take place. The inset magnifies the shaded region of the main plot which includes the neighborhood region adjacent to the global description length minimum. (b) The relative change of the description length and element-centric similarity during the course of algorithm iterations. The scan is done with $\Delta = 0.1$, starting at $(K_a, K_b) = (60, 60)$. The underlying network is a (4,6)-bipartite graph with $N = 1000$, $n_a / n_b = 1$, <k_a> = <k_b> = 30, and $I_r = 1.75$.
