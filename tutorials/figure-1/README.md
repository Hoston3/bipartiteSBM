Figure 1
=== 
benchmark/synthetic dataset that shows recovery of the correct planted Ka, Kb.- lambda on the horizontal axis, where lambda \in [0,1], from all noise to all structure.   
- NMI or AMI on the vertical axis. 
- Number of communities found.
    
This figure tells us
===
- [x] We can find the communities that we planted. 
- [x] As the communities get “lighter” the algorithm has more difficulty finding them.
