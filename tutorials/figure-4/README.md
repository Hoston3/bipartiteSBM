# Figure 4. 
Show that results are different on empirical datasets. 

Ka-Kb three heatmaps showing: biAlgm+Prbi; TPAlgm+Pruni; biAlgm+Pruni	

This shows three things:
# Demonstration of how theory & algorithm work on an empirical dataset.
# We do not see a single clear optimum using our method; in other prior, you do see a more densely concentrated optimum.
# Algorithm and prior both make a difference: our prior highlights more uncertainty, and our algorithm explores more of the space.
