## Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

This directory contains some Jupyter notebook tutorials for getting familiar with the
library. To load a tutorial, follow the [install instructions](../README.md) and then launch Jupyter.

With the philosophy of `reproducible science`,
we enclose the scripts that will generate the figures in the paper in each respective folder.
Meanwhile, the associated dataset is placed in [`dataset/`](../dataset).
