## Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

This directory contains some Jupyter notebook tutorials for getting familiar with the
library. To load a tutorial, follow the [install instructions](../README.md) and then launch Jupyter.

Adhering to the philosophy of `reproducible science`,
we enclose the scripts that will generate the published figures in `tutorials/reprods/`, as detailed as possible.
The associated dataset is placed in `dataset/`.
