# Figure 3 (Algorithm). 
Show that the algorithm has parameters which create a tradeoff between the results that you get and the time that it takes to get them. 
* A. Two search paths in Ka-Kb space, with the locations of full inference annotated. Each path comes from a different setting of the search parameters. 
* B. Heatmaps of many runs of the algorithm on the same networks and settings as panel A, showing how changing the parameters changes the distribution of results.
